## StriveSteady Development Documentation

### Week One

#### Technologies Used to Build this Web App

- **Backend:**
  - .NET (C#)
  - Entity Framework
  - SQLite for the database

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - JavaScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Material UI

During week one, our primary focus was on ensuring the backend and database components were functioning correctly. We also established a testing framework (XUnit) to implement the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology in the project, ensuring the application's robustness. This week was primarily dedicated to backend development.

Additionally, we implemented user account creation, allowing users to register via Google, Apple, LinkedIn, or directly within the application.
